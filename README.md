# Extreme spatial temperature events over Switzerland

## About the Project

### Description

This repository contains the code associated with my Master thesis : "Extreme spatial temperature events over Switzerland".

Predicting high temperatures is crucial for risk management, as they can impact public health, agriculture, infrastructure, and so on by causing health risks such as heatstroke, stress on crops and livestock, and damage to roads and bridges. The thesis consists of investigate the evolution of extreme temperatures in Switzerland between 1971 and 2022 by adapting the methodology described in the paper the "Inference for extreme spatial temperature events in a changing climate with application to Ireland" by Healy et al. 

The code is divided in ? parts

We model the tail of the marginal distribution with the generalized Pareto distribution and the extreme temperatures dependencies with a $r$-Pareto process.
